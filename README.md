# tfhe-aes
tFHE implementation of AES


# Brief Overview
This work is an implementation of AES in multiple modes (EBC, CBC, OFB, etc) that works in FHE. Our approach follows mostly this paper [Efficient Implementation of AES in 32 bit systems](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-36400-5_13.pdf), namely working with transposed state matrices improved performance. Furthermore, we decided to implement AES using the `tfhe::boolean` API, as we found that the "SubBytes" operation takes too much time using standard `FHEUint` types. To improve the performance of the `SubBytes` operation, we implemented a 8-bit multiplexer in the form of a boolean tree to represent each `SBOX`, which we then reduced using basic boolean logic to have the fewest operations possible. Evaluation of this boolean tree was done in a staged manner to allow for the most parallelism. 

During our research we came across multiple other papers implementing AES using FHE, namely: 
[Leveled Functional Bootstrapping via External Product Tree]()
[At Last! A Homomorphic AES Evaluation in Less than 30 Seconds by Means of TFHE]()

which had implemented new primitives and methods that enabled faster simultaneous bootstrapping operations and yielded much faster results. However, we have not tested whether these results were achieved with the security parameters as outlined in the challenge, yet they are definitely much faster than our implementation.

# In-depth Explanation

In this explanation, we will skim over the details of AES itself, and rather focus on the different parts of our solution that are unique.

## FHEByte
Firstly, we can see from the AES implementation that addition and subtraction of integers as a method is not used. As such, it would make sense to implement a FHEByte that uses all 8 bits for encryption (instead of 4 for message, and 4 for carry-over). The FHEByte is a wrapper around `[tfhe::boolean; 8]`, and we have implemented the standard logical methods (such as `xor`, `and`, `not`, 'shift-left' etc.), and other methods for convenience such as instantiating as from the clear `bool` or `u8`, or encrypted ones. 

## Boolean-tree and Multiplexer
The sub-bytes operation is the main source of performance cost for the AES-implementation. In ordinary clear implementations, there is usually an array `SBOX` such that indexing this array would give you the substitution: `sub-word(x) = SBOX[x]`. We decided to implement this array accessing by encoding it as an 8-bit multiplexer, where

# **Getting Started Guide: Building and Running the Program**

This guide will walk you through **building and running** the program, explaining its required arguments and expected behavior.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Rust** (latest stable version)  
  If Rust is not installed, you can install it using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):  
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
- **Cargo** (Rustâ€™s package manager, included with Rust)  

To verify that Rust and Cargo are installed, run:
```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

---

## **2. Setting Up the Project**  
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pjanthony2001/tfhe-aes && cd tfhe-aes  
```

---

## **3. Building the Program**
To compile the program, run:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
This will generate an optimized executable in the `target/release` directory.

For development builds (faster compilation but lower optimization), use:
```sh
cargo build
```

---

## **4. Running the Program**
The program requires several command-line arguments. Use the following format:
```sh
cargo run --release -- [OPTIONS]
```
Or, if you built the project:
```sh
./target/release/tfhe_aes [OPTIONS]
```

### **Available Arguments**
| Argument                     | Short | Description |
|------------------------------|:-----:|-------------|
| `--number-of-outputs <u8>`   | `-n`  | Number of random test blocks to generate (default: `1`). |
| `--iv <hex-string>`          | `-i`  | 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV) in hexadecimal format. |
| `--key <hex-string>`         | `-k`  | 16-byte encryption key in hexadecimal format. |
| `--key-expansion-offline`    | `-x`  | Enable offline key expansion (default: `false`). |
| `--mode <ECB\|CBC\|CTR\|OFB>` | `-m`  | Encryption mode (default: `CTR`). |

---

## **5. Example Usage**
### **Basic Example**
```sh
cargo run --release -- -i "00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF" -k "0F1571C947D9E8590CB7ADD6AF7F6798"
```
This runs the program with:
- IV: `00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF`
- Key: `0F1571C947D9E8590CB7ADD6AF7F6798`
- Default mode: `CTR`
- Default output count: `1`

### **Specifying a Mode and Multiple Outputs**
```sh
cargo run --release -- -n 5 -i "00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF" -k "0F1571C947D9E8590CB7ADD6AF7F6798" -m ECB
```
This runs the program with:
- 5 random output blocks
- IV and key specified in hex
- **ECB mode** instead of default `CTR`

### **Enabling Key Expansion Offline**
```sh
cargo run --release -- -i "00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF" -k "0F1571C947D9E8590CB7ADD6AF7F6798" -x
```
This enables **offline key expansion**.
